## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to create a website weather dashboard using server-side APIs from scratch.
- I worked on this project as a means to understand how to utilize Server-Side APIs in web developement.
- The problem this project solves is that it allows me to gain experience using server-side APIs, such as utilizing API keys and performing API calls within the project's code.
- I have learned that server-side APIs added an entire new level of functionality to web projects that vanilla javascript or even other API types cannot offer.
